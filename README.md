Quik Magento 2 Management by Merchant Protocol
--
To bring enjoyment back to the Magento command line, so that you'll like it again. Because having to remember long commands sucks.

Quik is designed to shorthand typical Magento operations so that you don't have to remember everything.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. I would never recomend relying on any script like this in a production environment. You should be deploying with an atomic process which doesn't require manipulation anway. lol.

### Prerequisites

This script specifically works when installed into your [Magento 2](https://magento.com) application.

### Installation

We have packaged this script to work with composer. Run the following command when inside your Magento 2 webroot.

> composer require merchantprotocol/quik
