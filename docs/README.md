Getting Started
--

Quik is designed to shorthand typical Magento operations so that you don't have to remember everything.  Built by Merchant Protocolâ€‹

With Quik all of your complicated commands are stored safe into short Quik commands. Need to reset your stores file permissions? quik permi, done. We've optimized each of our commands to run as fast as possible on stores with millions of files. Not only are they shorthand, they're quick!

## Installation via Composer

Through the command line on linux cd into your Magento 2 webroot. Assuming you have composer installed already.

#### Run this command in your Magento 2 Webroot.

> composer require merchantprotocol/quik

I've found that packagist doesn't update as quick as I'd like, so try this if the above doesn't give you the latest version:

> composer require merchantprotocol/quik ^0.0.3 --prefer-source

## Set Vendor Bin Path

Quik bash command script is installed into `vendor/bin/quik` you can use it from this location by typing out the entire path each time you want to run commands. Or you can place the `vendor/bin` directory into your path variable on unix machines.

This command assumes that you've installed your Magento webroot into `/var/www/html` as is default on most unix webservers.

> export PATH=/var/www/html/vendor/bin/:$PATH

All commands in this documentation will assume that you've set the vendor bin path.
