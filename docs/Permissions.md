 Permissions

Usage: quik permi [options]
 Update the file permissions for your magento installation. This command will
 run an optimized script to only locate those files which do not already have the
 proper permissions. For large codebases this will significantly speed up this
 operation.

Options:
  -h, --help          Show this message
  -y                  Disable the maintenance page.
